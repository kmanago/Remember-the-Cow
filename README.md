# Remember the Cow

##Description
You will create a web page for a fictional online to-do list site called "Remember the Cow", which is a parody of the real to-do list web site "Remember the Milk".  Your site requires the user to log in or create an account first.  After logging in, the user can manipulate his/her to-do list by adding or deleting items. Any changes made to the list are saved to the web server, so that if the user leaves the page and returns later, the state of the list is remembered.
